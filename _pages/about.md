I am a graduate student at Tianjin University with a passion for bug hunting and developing efficient testing tools!
My research focuses on designing effective methods to discover security vulnerabilities in major targets. For the past three years, my main test targets have been browser Javascript kernels such as JavaScriptCore, V8, SpiderMonkey, etc.
