I am a graduate student at Tianjin University with a passion for bug hunting and developing efficient testing tools!

My research focuses on designing effective methods to discover security vulnerabilities in major targets. For the past three years, my main test targets have been browser Javascript kernels such as JavaScriptCore, V8, SpiderMonkey, etc.

With my mentor and I working together, we have achieved some small achievements in the field of browser vulnerability mining, including tens of thousands of dollars in bounties as well as academic papers.

Recently, I've turned my attention to WebAssembly, which I think has a lot of potential and is now supported by all major browsers. Therefore, it will be the next focus of my research. I've implemented a tool to fuzz WebAssembly parts of browsers, based on an idea presented at Black Hat Asia 2023. The tool has detected 9 unique crashes in JavaScriptCore and SpiderMonkey in their WebAssembly parts, all of which have been identified as vulnerabilities by the vendors. However, I'm relatively new to exploiting WebAssembly vulnerabilities, and I don't know how to do anything with them yet. If you are interested in WebAssembly, please feel free to discuss it with me.
