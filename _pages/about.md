I am a graduate student at Tianjin University in Prof.[Junjie Wang](https://zhunki.github.io/index.html)â€™s group with a passion for **bug hunting** and developing efficient testing tools!

My research focuses on designing effective methods to discover security vulnerabilities in major targets. For the past three years, my main test targets have been browser's JavaScript kernels such as **JavaScriptCore**, **V8**, **SpiderMonkey**, etc.

With my mentor and I working together, we have got some small achievements in the field of **browser** vulnerability hunting, including tens of thousands of dollars in bounties as well as academic papers.

Prof. [Junjie Wang](https://zhunki.github.io/index.html) is serious and down-to-earth in her work and has a gentle personality. 
As for the guidance to students, she will be involved in the details of the work, so the communication between her and students is very efficient. 
**There are currently openings for postgraduates in our lab**, so if you are interested in software security, why not come together and do something fun! 
Welcome to send an email to *junjie.wang@tju.edu.cn* with a CV.
